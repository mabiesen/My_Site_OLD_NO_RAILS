# ResponsiveResume-XHTML
Goal is to create resume and portfolio that are fully responsive.  Inspired by recent work with Unity, an extremely versatile application that allows one to create apps for a variety of platforms.

Updates as of 1/2/2017:
* Obtained domain matthewbiesen.com, linked html to website.
* Portfolio boxes now contain summary space.  Anticipating links, and Javascript to change summaries based on click/mouseover.
* Moved name to right side ("About Matthew Biesen") in cv because name was interfering with picture and seemed out of place in the picture. 


Anticipating:
*  Wix to release namespace for mattbiesen.com.  Submitted request, put in ticket. Then link to matthewbiesen.com.
*  To create index page.  Index page will make it easy to highlight major projects and provide a familiar place from and to which the user can navigate.
*  To link Resume and Coverletter to cv page.  They will be displayed in pdf form with a print option. Change star reference to portfolio.
*  Provide a print option for all career-related web pages, and an easy print-all.
*  Provide page of travel and hobbies.
*  Provide information on the Biesen Brothers and link to website.
