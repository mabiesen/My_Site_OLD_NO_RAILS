# ResponsiveResume-XHTML
Goal is to create resume and portfolio that are fully responsive.  Inspired by recent work with Unity, an extremely versatile application that allows one to create apps for a variety of platforms.

Late Update 1/4/2017:
* mattbiesen.com successfully directed to matthewbiesen.com. NOTE: As of this time, I have not updated matthewbiesen.com.
* Project increased in scope!!! This is going to be an all-in-one Matthew Biesen website that will house my interests as well as career pursuits.
* Added headers, pdf resume page, homepage, page for pi/arduino project pictures.  Site contains links to additional pages that have yet to be created.

Update as of 1/4/2017:
* Instructed Godaddy to associated mattbiesen.com with mattthewbiesen.com.  Not yet working.
* Added scroll animation to porfolio.  Before update, if text was changed and scroll bar was down, scroll bar would stay down.  Now, text is scrolled to top in animation fashion.

Updates as of 1/3/2017:
* Added text and hyperlinks for portfolio projects
* Added js to show when link is clicked in portfolio

Updates as of 1/2/2017:
* Obtained domain matthewbiesen.com, linked html to website.
* Portfolio boxes now contain summary space.  Anticipating links, and Javascript to change summaries based on click/mouseover.
* Moved name to right side ("About Matthew Biesen") in cv because name was interfering with picture and seemed out of place in the picture. 


Anticipating:
*  Fix all typos and missing spaces in portfolio
*  Search Pis for more scripts to load to Github; currently lacking for certain languages.
*  Wix to release namespace for mattbiesen.com.  Submitted request, put in ticket. Then link to matthewbiesen.com.
*  To create index page.  Index page will make it easy to highlight major projects and provide a familiar place from and to which the user can navigate.
*  To link Resume and Coverletter to cv page.  They will be displayed in pdf form with a print option. Change star reference to portfolio on CV page.
*  Provide a print option for all career-related web pages, and an easy print-all.
*  Provide page of travel and hobbies.
*  Provide information on the Biesen Brothers and link to website.
