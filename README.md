# ResponsiveResume-XHTML
Goal is to create resume and portfolio that are fully responsive.  Inspired by recent work with Unity.

Updates as of 1/2/2017:
1. Obtained domain matthewbiesen.com, linked html to website.
2. Portfolio boxes now contain summary space.  Anticipating links, and Javascript to change summaries based on click/mouseover.
3. Moved name to right side ("About Matthew Biesen") in cv because name was interfering with picture and seemed out of place in the picture.
4. 


Anticipating:
1.  Wix to release namespace for mattbiesen.com.  Submitted request, put in ticket. Then link to matthewbiesen.com.
2.  To create index page.  Index page will make it easy to highlight major projects and provide a familiar place from and to which the user can navigate.
3.  To link Resume and Coverletter to cv page.  They will be displayed in pdf form with a print option.
4.  Provide a print option for all career-related web pages, and an easy print-all.
5.  Provide page of travel and hobbies.
6.  Provide information on the Biesen Brothers and link to website.
