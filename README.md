# ResponsiveResume-XHTML
Tested moving elements around on the page over time as the page loads to provide some sense of motion and make the page more interesting.

It looks OK, but not very exciting.  To spice it up, I could include a dropdown of links on the side of the page that slide into view after the elements have loaded and the page is fully faded in.  I need to experiment more with HTML canvas and provide motion backgrounds if possible.
