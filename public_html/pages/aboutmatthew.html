    <h2 class="w3-wide">About Me - Matthew Biesen</h2></hr>
    <p class="w3-justify">I was born to Terence and LeeAnn Biesen at Munster Community Hospital in Indiana on February 4th, 1988.  My mother worked for the family flower shop, Lamprecht's
	Florist, as a florist and store manager; my father simultaneously worked for Arcelor Mittal as a mechanic and another family busines, Highland Furnace, as an HVAC specialist.  I have one younger brother
	and no other siblings.</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">I was raised in Highland, Indiana and attended Southridge Elementary School from kindergarten through sixth grade.  While at Southridge I was selected for 
	Academic Arts Talented Program, an after school program that aims to expand minds through fun activities involving learning new languages and conducting science experiments (among other things).
	In sixth grade I was selected to participate in an inter-school spelling bee; our team one first place.  During this timeframe I also swam for the Highland Hurricanes swim team
	and regularly qualified for state competitions.</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">I began attending Highland High School in 2002 and continued to engage in extracurricular pursuits.  Extracurricular activities included: chess club, chess tutoring to elementary schoolers, philosophic study,
	debate, key club, robotics, fencing, and tennis.  Debate was by far my favorite activity as it allowed a trial-by-fire of the philosophies that I had been studying.  With regards to classes, I was enrolled in several AP courses 
	including English, Calculus, and Physics.  In 2006 I graduated high school with Academic Honors and a 3.3 GPA.</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">I began attending Bradley University in August 2006 with intentions of studying Philosophy and Physics in preparation for law school.  In my sophomore year I changed my double major to Philosophy and Psychology
	 and added a minor in Business Management.  My grades were strong throughout my four years at Bradley:  I was inducted into the Pi Gamma Mu liberal arts honors society, I was inducted into Psi Chi psychology honors society,
	and I graduated Cum Laude with a 3.57 GPA.  Extracurricular activities during my time at Bradley included:  a club I created called Socrates' Cafe, rock climbing at the university gym, reading, studying, and chess with friends.</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">I graduated Bradley University on time in 2010.  The job market was not great at this time and I worked a number of odd positions until I was hired  by NIPSCO as a Budget Analyst in August of 2013.    Budet Analysts act in the capacity of an Operations Specialist:
	 invoicing, routing documents for approval, opening and closing work orders, assignment of FERC accounts to work orders, forecast reporting, earned value analysis, variance reporting, accrual reporting, tax reporting assistance
	, 0-12 budget entry, maintaining work order SOX compliance, record checking completed work orders, and accounting error identification/correction.  I was personally responsible for NIPSCO's Major Projects division and managed multi-million dollar projects which totaled arounde 200M dollars.  I was also responsible for projects related to Schaffer Generating Station and IT. </br>
	In July of 2015 I was promoted to Sr. Budget Analyst. To reduce errors and increase efficiency, I began studying Excel, VBA, and Access in my off hours.  Through my efforts I created many ways to increase the efficiency of the Budget Analyst team, most notably: a personal macro workbook to automate menial Excel tasks(pivot table creation, unhide sheets, work order conversion, etc.),
	a series of macros to manage forecast and accrual reporting of 93 work orders in 42 workbooks, and an Access database to allow for YTD reporting by department(a feature which was not provided by our new accounting system).</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">In early 2016 I became discontent with my position for a number of reasons.  Budget Analysts rely heavily on accounting for guidelines in their daily work;
	Budget Analysts were regularly critiqued negatively on their choice of FERC and NOE accounts but were rarely provided written guidance from accounting teams.  There was a period of turnover where the manager and director left the department, and for over
	a month my team was left without any form of managerial guidance or general guidance on the path forward.  My team was then split into two groups, I received a new director who left the department after a few weeks and I received a temporary manager who was located in another state and had no
	experience in our field.  I was denied tuition reimbursement for Data Management classes though I had already proven the value of such classes.  For these reasons and more, I left NIPSCO in October of 2016.
	<p class="w3-justify">Programming became my career of choice for a number of reasons: programming is always logical, results can be immediately tested, most languages can be learned online free of charge, and it is clear from my experience at NIPSCO
    that many major companies have not yet leveraged the efficiency benefits of low cost technology.  Immediately upon leaving NIPSCO I began to rigorously study programming languages.
	Between October of 2016 and January 2017 I learned the following languages:  CSS/HTML/XML, Javascript/Jquery, Ruby, Golang, Python, PHP, Arduino(C/C++), and C#.  My education is obtained from books, CodeCademy, and deconstruction of completed code.</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">Programming is broad field of which I have only touched the surface, but I have no doubt that I will obtain the career in programming that I desire.</p>
